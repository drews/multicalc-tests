### Submitting the Assignment

_Make sure that the todo assignment and this assignment are both done. You will be submitting both PR links on the same form._

1. Fork Code-the-Dream-School/multicalc-tests to your own GitHub account.
1. Clone that down to you local machine and create a working branch.
1. Run through the tests - they should fail because you haven't debugged the source files yet. (**IMPORTANT: Don’t make any changes to the test files!**)
1. Investigate the _source files_ and iteratively make changes such that more and more test cases start to pass. 
1. Once all your tests pass, publish your working branch to GitHub.
1. Open a PR againt your fork this repo (likely, https://github.com/${USER}/multicalc-tests/
1. Add the PR link into the second URL field for the week's assignment submission.
